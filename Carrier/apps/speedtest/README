Arguments to the following two options are mandatory in order to use the program:

-c configuration file

-f file to transfer or be saved as

Additionally, if you want to friend someone, just provide his address through the -a option.

If the -a option is not used, the argument to the -f option is the file to tranfer.
Otherwise, it's the file to be saved as.
